{"name":"omg_validator","body":"# OmgValidator\r\n\r\nOmgValidator is a collection of custom validators for Rails 3.x. These are simple validators that mostly use regular expressions for common validation requirements, including:\r\n\r\n* Alpha-dash characters\r\n* Alphanumeric characters\r\n* Alpha characters\r\n* Dates\r\n* Decimal numbers\r\n* Email addresses\r\n* Integer numbers\r\n* IP addresses\r\n* Numeric characters\r\n* US and Canadian (or compatible) Phone numbers\r\n* US and Canadian (or compatible) Postal/Zip Codes\r\n* Strong passwords\r\n* URL\r\n* US (or compatible) Zip Code\r\n\r\nUsing the gem is easy. Just add it to your gemfile.\r\n\r\n  gem \"omg_validator\", \"~> 0.0.8\"\r\n\r\nRun bundle install and then use them in your models. For example:\r\n\r\n  validates :postal_code, postal_or_zip_code: true\r\n\r\nThink of this package as a swiss army knife for your validation needs. It larges replaces the need to use validates_format_of validation helper method. \r\n\r\nThe decimal, integer, and numeric validators do overlap with functionality in the validates_numericality_of validation helper method. We have kept these in the gem however, as we personally find them easier to use. The validates_numericality_of method is still immensely useful for more complex numeric validations.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n* Nickolas Kenyeres\r\n* Michael Mottola\r\n\r\n### How to Contribute\r\n\r\nThis project is in active development.
