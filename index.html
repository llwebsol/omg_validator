        <h1>OmgValidator</h1>

<p>OmgValidator is a collection of custom validators for Rails 3.x. These are simple validators that mostly use regular expressions for common validation requirements, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alpha-dash characters</li>
<li>Alphanumeric characters</li>
<li>Alpha characters</li>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li>US and Canadian (or compatible) Phone numbers</li>
<li>US and Canadian (or compatible) Postal/Zip Codes</li>
<li>Strong passwords</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>US (or compatible) Zip Code</li>
</ul><p>Using the gem is easy. Just add it to your gemfile.</p>

<p>gem "omg_validator", "~&gt; 1.0.0"</p>

<p>Run bundle install and then use them in your models. For example:</p>

<p>validates :postal_code, postal_or_zip_code: true</p>

<p>Think of this package as a swiss army knife for your validation needs. It larges replaces the need to use validates_format_of validation helper method.</p>
